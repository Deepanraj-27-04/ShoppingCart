# Shopping Cart System

This is a simple Java-based Shopping Cart System that allows users to add items to their cart, specify quantities, and calculate the total price using different pricing strategies (e.g., regular price, with discount, and with tax). The system is designed to allow for the addition of new pricing strategies without modifying the core logic, using the Strategy Design Pattern.

## Features

- Add items to the cart by providing item name and quantity.
- Calculate total price using:
  - Regular pricing.
  - Discount pricing (e.g., 10% discount).
  - Tax pricing (e.g., 5% tax).
- Easily extendable to support new pricing strategies.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- A Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor.
- Basic knowledge of Java and object-oriented programming concepts.
